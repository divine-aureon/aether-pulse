          Crown Achievements mark your defining moments — the milestones where discipline, intention,
          and mastery align. Every crown earned represents a personal victory: syncing daily, hitting
          PRs, mastering your meals, or staying consistent through resistance.
          This isn&apos;t about flashy badges or empty rewards. Crowns are earned through real effort,
          and each one reflects your evolving commitment to your form — physical, mental, and energetic.
          Crown types include:
          Sync Streaks — for showing up daily, even when it&apos;s hard.
          Strength Milestones — PRs, total rep records, volume surges.
          Nutrient Mastery — logging complete meals with accurate macros & micros.
          Consistency Crowns — staying within your calorie zone for a full week.
          Recovery Honors — logging rest days, managing soreness, and staying aligned.
          Crowns are visible proof that you&apos;re not just going through the motions —
          you&apos;re building your form, one intentional day at a time.
          Earn them. Reflect on them. Let them remind you who you are becoming.
